# Chat Room
Chat room application implementation using WebSocket.

## Background
WebSocket is a communication protocol that makes it possible to establish a two-way communication channel between a
server and a client.

## Work Completed

The message model is the message payload that is exchanged between the client and the server. Implemented the Message
class in the chat module.  Three basic actions are covered:
1. ENTER
2. CHAT
3. LEAVE

### Completed WebSocketChatServer
Implemented all TODOs that were inside WebSocketChatServer in order to implement each method's description.

### Run the application with command
